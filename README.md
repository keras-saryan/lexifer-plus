# Lexifer Plus

This is an adaptation of [Lexifer Online][1] by [Wm Annis][2] and [u/bbrk][3], the original documentation for which can be found [here][4]. Lexifer Plus retains the core underlying functionalities of Lexifer Online with certain aesthetic modifications and quality-of-life improvements. These are summarised below.

## Form

* Modified theme with both dark and light modes (🌚/🌞)
* Toggle between sans and serif font (🔡/✒️)
* Wider format for the main body
* Removal of line breaks in paragraph outputs

## Function

* Import/export of `.def` files, including drag-and-drop support
* Copy output directly to clipboard
* Save output to `.wli` for easier import into [Lexurgy][5]
* Shareable URL that preserves the current state of the page
* Extensive keyboard shortcuts with a built-in cheat sheet (❓)
